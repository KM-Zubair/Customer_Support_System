# LangChain Chat with Your Data

This project builds a conversational chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI, enabling question-answering from various document sources, including PDFs, YouTube transcripts, URLs, and optionally, Notion databases. It utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient and contextually accurate responses from embedded document data.

## Project Overview

The chatbot follows these main steps:

1. **Document Loading** - Load documents from sources such as PDF files, YouTube videos, and URLs.
2. **Document Splitting** - Split documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks.
3. **Vector Stores and Embeddings** - Generate embeddings for each document chunk and store them in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
4. **RetrievalQA Chain** - Use a chain for retrieving relevant document segments to answer queries (optional).
5. **Conversational Retrieval Chain** - Set up a conversational chain for handling multi-turn question-answering with memory.
6. **Web-Based User Interface** - Deploy the chatbot with a web-based interface using Flask.

## Project Structure

```
langchain_chat/
├── app.py                # Main Flask application for the chatbot API
├── loaders.py            # Document loading from various sources
├── splitter.py           # Document splitting logic
├── vectorstore.py        # Embeddings and vector store setup
├── qa_chain.py           # RetrievalQA chain setup (optional)
├── conversation_chain.py # Conversational retrieval chain setup
└── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
```

## Requirements

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:
```
Flask
langchain
chromadb
openai
```

## How to Run

1. **Load Documents**: Customize `loaders.py` with the desired document URLs, YouTube links, or paths to local PDF files.
2. **Start the Flask App**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Interact with the API**: Send POST requests to the `/chat` endpoint with JSON input:
   
   ```json
   { "message": "Your question here" }
   ```

   The response will contain the chatbot's answer based on the loaded documents.

## Workflow

### 1. Document Loading

Load documents by specifying URLs, YouTube links, or file paths. See `loaders.py` for examples.

### 2. Document Splitting

Split loaded documents into smaller chunks for efficient embedding. Adjust the chunk size in `splitter.py` as needed.

### 3. Vector Stores and Embedding

Embed document chunks and store them in a vector database. Run `vectorstore.py` to initialize the vector database.

### 4. RetrievalQA Chain (Optional)

An optional RetrievalQA chain setup is available in `qa_chain.py` for handling single-turn queries.

### 5. Conversational Retrieval Chain

Set up a conversational chain with memory in `conversation_chain.py` to handle multi-turn dialogues.

### 6. Web-Based Interface

Run `app.py` to start the web server for interacting with the chatbot. This exposes an API for the frontend to send user queries.

## Future Work

Consider adding advanced retrieval techniques for handling similarity search challenges, such as diverse indexing and specificity improvements.
